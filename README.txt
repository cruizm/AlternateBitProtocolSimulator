/*************/

0 - alternatebitprotocol.doc contains the explanation of this simulator

1 - Run the unit tests
	2.1. Run subnet test
		1 - Open the terminal. Press in your keyboard Ctrl+Alt+t
		2 - Set the command prompt in the project folder. To do so, type in the terminal the path to this folder.
			Example: cd Documents/AlternateBitProtocol
		3 - To compile the test, type in the terminal:
			make clean; make all
		4 - To run the test, change directory to bin folder where the executables are located. For example: cd bin. type in the terminal "./NAME_OF_THE_COMPILED_FILE". For this specific test you need to type:
			./SUBNET_TEST
		5 - To check the output of the test, open  "test/data/subnet/subnet_test_output.txt"
	2.2. To run receiver and sender tests, the steps are analogous to 2.1, just select the appropriate path
			
3 - Run the simulator
	1 - Open the terminal. Press in your keyboard Ctrl+Alt+t
	2 - Set the command prompt in the project folder. To do so, type in the terminal the path to this folder.
		Example: cd Documents/AlternateBitProtocol
	3 - To compile the project, type in the terminal:
		make clean; make all
	4 - To run the simulation, type in the terminal "./NAME_OF_THE_COMPILED_FILE NAME_OF_THE_INPUT_FILE". For this test you need to type:
		./ABP ../data/input_abp_0
	5 - To check the output of the simulation, open  "data/abp_output.txt"
	6 - To execute the simulator with different inputs
		6.1. Create new .txt files with the same structure as input_abp_0.txt or input_abp_1.txt
		6.2. Run the simulator using the instructions in step 4
		6.3. If you want to keep the output, rename abp_output.txt. To do so, type in the terminal: "mv abp_output.txt NEW_NAME"
			Example: mv abp_output.txt abp_output_0.txt
